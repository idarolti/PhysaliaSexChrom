## 01. Read trimming and quality check

* **[Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)** - A read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data

    The following command will trim reads to remove adapter sequences, regions where the average Phred score in sliding windows of four bases was <15, reads for which the leading/trailing bases had a Phred score <3, and paired-end reads where either read pair was <50 bp. You can use the command on each pair (forward + reverse) of fastq.gz files
